## Weekly report 6

This week I mostly optimized the hallway generation. Now the program can avoid generating a hallway incorrectly in most cases.
The user inputs have clear limits and that eliminates the risk of falling into an infinite loop. 
Next thing I'll do is write some more tests and fix bugs I might find in the process.
I have worked for about 12 hours this week.
